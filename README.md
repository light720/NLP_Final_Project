# NLP_Final_Project
This project is used for NLP Final Project, it built a Sentiment Analysis model based on VADER, and tried to use it for Dogecoin price movement prediction

This project contains 4 different Jupyter Notebooks, they all created by me. 
1. The Twitter data pulling notebook contain all the code I have used to pull Twitter data through its API. It mainly has two different segments: Tweepy code I used to download all Elon Musk related tweets. Another part to download daily #Dogecoin discussion tweets.
2. Elon Musk Data Cleaning and Assessment Code is used to clean Elon Musk's tweets and do a basic data analysis based on the data.
3. Dogecoin Data Cleaning Code is used to clean #Dogecoin tweets related data and feed the cleaned data to VADER to build a sentiment analysis model.
4. Final Modeling Code is used to do the final data cleaning for macro economy variables and do model testing.
